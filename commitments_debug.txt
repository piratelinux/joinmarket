2: Utxos that have less than 5 confirmations:
None
3: Utxos that were not at least 20% of the size of the coinjoin amount 8000000
None
***
Utxos that appeared in item 1 cannot be used again.
Utxos only in item 2 can be used by waiting for more confirmations, (set by the value of taker_utxo_age).
Utxos only in item 3 are not big enough for this coinjoin transaction, set by the value of taker_utxo_amtpercent.
If you cannot source a utxo from your wallet according to these rules, use the tool add-utxo.py to source a utxo external to your joinmarket wallet. Read the help with 'python add-utxo.py --help'

You can also reset the rules in the joinmarket.cfg file, but this is generally inadvisable.
***
For reference, here are the utxos in your wallet:
